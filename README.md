This repo contains the code and data to estimate d15N based on Landsat spectra and ground-based d15N data. 

Details of this appraoch can be found in Yang et al. 2023.

The repo is organised as follow: 

The main file has example of how to predict d15N based on Landsat.  

The R folder has the function to do the prediction.

The cache folder has the data and fitted model needed to make the prediction. 

Note: 

If one would like to fit the model themselves with other language/platform. The data to do the fitting is 'cache/groundDN15.rds'.
